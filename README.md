# Graded-Assignment-on-MERN-Application-with-Grafana-and-Prometheus
Assignment Tasks:

1. MERN Application Setup:

   - Deploy a travel memory application in your local machine.

2. Integrate Prometheus:

   - Integrate Prometheus metrics into the Node.js backend. Use client libraries to expose custom metrics like API response times, request counts, and error rates.

   - Set up MongoDB monitoring using an exporter, such as MongoDB Exporter, to track database performance.

3. Enhance Grafana Dashboards:

   - Create advanced Grafana dashboards to display both the default and custom metrics from the MERN application.

   - Include detailed visualizations for backend performance, database health, and frontend performance (if possible).

4. Log Aggregation:

   - Integrate a log aggregation system (such as Loki, ELK Stack, or Fluentd) to collect and visualize logs from the MERN application.

   - Create a dashboard in Grafana to explore and analyze these logs.

5. Implement Distributed Tracing:

   - Set up distributed tracing in the application using tools like Jaeger or Zipkin.

   - Integrate tracing data into Grafana for a full view of request flows through the application stack.

6. Alerting and Anomaly Detection:

   - Develop sophisticated alerting rules in Grafana based on application-specific metrics and log patterns.

   - Explore anomaly detection with Grafana, using the gathered metrics and logs.

7. Documentation and Analysis:

   - Document the entire setup process, including challenges and how they were addressed.

   - Provide an analysis of the application performance and behavior based on the collected metrics, logs, and traces.

   - Include screenshots and explanations of the Grafana dashboards.

8. Bonus (Optional):

   - Implement auto-scaling mechanisms based on specific metrics.

   - Explore service mesh integration (like Istio or Linkerd) for more advanced observability features.
